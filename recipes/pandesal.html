        <p>A favorite Filipino breakfast roll, this pandesal is a bit sweet and crusted 
            with fine bread crumbs before baking.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/8 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                <li>1/8 cup fine breadcrumbs, divided (or as needed)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour yeast into water. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and set aside to 
                    soften, about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix 1/4 cup sugar, oil, and salt together in a bowl. Add softened 
                    yeast mixture and 1/2 of the flour. Mix well. Add remaining flour 
                    little by little, mixing constantly, until dough does not stick to 
                    the sides of the mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. 
                    Form into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Brush surface of 
                    dough with more vegetable oil and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in 
                    a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Punch dough down and roll into 2-inch rounds. Cover rolls with 1/2 of 
                    the fine bread crumbs and let rise again, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cut rounds into 1 1/2-inch pieces and arrange on a slightly greased 
                    baking sheet, cut-side up. Sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs and 
                    let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until slightly brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><em>You can use shortening instead of vegetable oil, if preferred.</em></p>
