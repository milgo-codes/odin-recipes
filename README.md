Info
I'm planning on using this readme as both a pre- and post- reflection on this Recipes project, so bear with me.


Reflections Upon Start
I am looking forward to this process a lot. I feel like I have a pretty good feel for using the command line-- it's streamlined a lot of what makes creating slow! I am most excited about using HTML. Hopefully I can remember what I need from the boilerplate. I'm feeling like a lot of Googling is in my cards.

Reflectons Upon Finish
...That was really fun. It felt like solving a puzzle, or neatly organizing a cabinet full of files. Initially I didn't understand the Git commands or commit process at all, but now I actually get what they mean and what they do. I feel proud of myself and really enjoyed the process of learning and problem-solving.
