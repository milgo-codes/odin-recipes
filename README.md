# odin-recipes

I'm planning on using this readme as both a pre- and post- reflection on this Recipes project, so bear with me.

Reflections Upon Start
I am looking forward to this process a lot. I feel like I have a pretty good feel for using the command line-- it's streamlined a lot of what makes creating slow! I am most excited about using HTML. Hopefully I can remember what I need from the boilerplate. I'm feeling like a lot of Googling is in my cards.
